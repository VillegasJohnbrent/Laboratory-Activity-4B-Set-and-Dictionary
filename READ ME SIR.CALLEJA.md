I know it’s a bit forward of me to ask this, but I couldn't find you anywhere on campus on April 3, 2025, during the scheduled time for grade consultation(10-12PM/1-3PM). I even checked with the Admin Assistant, but they didn’t know where you were either.

If possible, could you please consider adding my Activity 4 and Lab 4 to my final grades? I’d really appreciate it.
